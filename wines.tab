1	2007 Vilmart & Cie 'Coeur de Cuvee' Premier Cru Brut	"On the nose, the first aromas of hazelnut and brioche awake the senses. After a few moments, with much of elegance, subtle notes of vanilla and dried fruit are married with more subtle lemony flavors. The nose is both elegant and powerful, which indicates a wine of great complexity and a beautiful harmony. The palate is lively and the effervescence is very fine."		Brut	Champagne Vilmart	750	2007	1

On the palate, taste the honeyed orange flower, candied citrus fruits and beautiful mouth-feel which is simultaneously rich and restrained. The complexity of the aromas and flavours are almost precision-engineered."	12	Brut	Champagne Salon	750	1997	3
4	Dom Perignon Rose	"The palate is concentrated and remarkably well-defined. The fullness is structured, rich. The silky, spicy material very gradually disappears into a mineral, iodine, salty finish. The nose incites a burst of richness and complexity. Ripe fruit at first, then fig and strawberry as the wine breathes and grows, revealing guava, violet and vanilla."		Extra Brut	Dom Perignon	750	2003	4

7	The Sadie Family Die Ouwingerdreeks 'Skurfberg' White	"The Ouwingerdreeks, or Old Vine Series are all extremely limited South African wine releases. The Skurfberg is Chenin Blanc from near 90 year old vines in Olifants River. It's a very fresh and pure with melon and honey notes and a chalky finish.

The palate has a fresh acidity with rich flavours of Seville marmalade and dried apricots enveloping the mouth. These fruity notes are married with sandal wood and all spice flavours. Richly aromatic that tapers into a elegant and endless finish. MATURATION The wine was aged in a combination of 60 % new French oak, Hungarian oak and French Acacia oak for a period of 4 years on the gross lees. No racking or movement of the wine occurs until the final blend has been made up. BARREL AGING There are multiple methods of macerating and fermenting the grapes for Vin de Constance and are dependent on the phase and batch that comes into the cellar. Some methods include cold maceration on the skins for up to 2 weeks. Each batch is lightly pressed off and fermentation is allowed to continue for 6 months to a year in 500l barrels."	14	Very sweet	Klein Constantia	500	2009	8
9	meerlust rubicon stellenbosch	"The 2013 Rubicon classic expression of this iconic Cape wine. Very deep, youthful colour, and intense almost purple hue. Very classic Rubicon nose with violets, ripe plum, cedar wood and intense spiciness. A typical liquorice note and stony minerality also evident on the nose. Still youthful and intense, promising further maturation potential. The palate is full bodied, structured by beautifully sleek, ripe tannins which restrain the vibrant dark fruit typical of this vintage, giving the wine an opulent texture which is kept focused by the linear acidity. The wine lingers on the palate with creamy fruit mouthfiilling tannins."	13.5	Very Dry	Meerlust Estate	750	2013	9
10	Rupert & Rothschild Vignerons Classique	Inviting red blend with fresh raspberry aromas and pomegranate undertones. This wine has a smooth balanced palate with lingering cranberry and cedarwood nuances.	13.5	Very Dry	Rupert & Rothschild Vignerons	750	2013	10
11	Ken Forrester Old Vine Reserve Chenin Blanc	"Golden hued and full bodied, with melon and spicy baked apple aromas. Layered, with mineral notes enhanced by honeycomb and caramel flavours from lees contact. This wine is a great example of the harmonious balance which can be achieved between fruit and delicate oak/vanilla flavours, as they combine to form complex, soft flavours with sufficient body to enhance even spicy and full flavoured meals."	13.5	Dry	Ken Forrester Vinyards	750		11
12	Black Label Pinotage	"A very complex wine with hints of red fruit flavours which reflects some Pinot Noir style elegance and structure. Big, bold tannin structures which are down played by ripe tannins and elegance."	14.6	Dry	Kanonkop	750	2015	12
