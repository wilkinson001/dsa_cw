1	Champagne	"The Champagne wine region (archaic English: Champany) is a historic province within the administrative province of Champagne in the northeast of France. The area is best known for the production of the sparkling white wine that bears the region's name. EU law and the laws of most countries reserve the term ""Champagne"" exclusively for wines that come from this region located about 100 miles (160 km) east of Paris. The viticultural boundaries of Champagne are legally defined and split into five wine producing districts within the administrative province: Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. The towns of Reims and Épernay are the commercial centers of the area."	France	Oceanic	1333000	34305	619	2343.75	2741310000	2214135000	13
2	South Africa	"South African wine has a history dating back to 1659 with Constantia, a vineyard near Cape Town. Access to international markets lead to new investment in the South African wine market. Production is concentrated around Cape Town, with major vineyard and production centres at Paarl, Stellenbosch and Worcester. There are about 60 appellations within the Wine of Origin (WO) system, which was implemented in 1973 with a hierarchy of designated production regions, districts and wards. WO wines must only contain grapes from the specific area of origin. ""Single vineyard"" wines must come from a defined area of less than 5 hectares. An ""Estate Wine"" can come from adjacent farms if they are farmed together and wine is produced on site. A ward is an area with a distinctive soil type or climate and is roughly equivalent to a European appellation."	South Africa	Temperate	52980000	98597	464	11540000	818000000		14
